# card-sorting 
## genetic-algorithms
the problem is : 
	You have 10 cards numbered from 1 to 10
	You have to divide them into two piles so that:
	The sum of the first pile is as close as possible to 36.
	And the product of all in the second pile is as close as possible to 360.
### Population size : 
	6 
### Number of generation :
	30
### Chromosome:
_ the chromosome used is a list of size 10  with 2 tuples each tuple contain different numbers from 1 to 10 

### Termination criteria:
	Maximum number of generations reached 
	Found the optimist solution where sum of first pile is 36 and product of second one the 360

### Initial population :
Choose random genes (samples ) from the cards list for pile 1 and 2 (with a clear condition that each tuple consists different numbers 
The fitness function of my code Is : 

F =  (1 )/(absolute error of first pile)+  1/(absolute error of second pile)  

### Selection :
Select three parents with the highest fitness value  
### Crossover used : 
using the concept of simple order crossover between 1st and 2nd parent and between 2nd and 3rd parent
